# TerminalCraft

TerminalCraft is a [Young Software Makers](https://ysws.hackclub.com) program that rewards teenagers for creating original terminal-based programs with a Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB)!

## 🎯 The Challenge

Create an original program that runs in the terminal. If your submission is approved, you'll receive a Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB) to continue your programming journey!

## 📝 Submission Requirements

1. **Self-Contained**: Your program must be self-contained and should not assume the existence of another program on the computer that it can take advantage of.

2. **API Independence**: The program must not be entirely dependent on external APIs.

3. **Originality**: It must not be a remake of an existing terminal program or game.

4. **No Wrappers**: It must not be a wrapper around an existing program/API to make it "nicer".

5. **Linux Compatibility**: Your program must be able to run on Linux, as this is the operating system used on the Raspberry Pi. You must provide pre-built binaries that can run on Linux without requiring compilation.

6. **Terminal-Only**: Your program must run entirely in the terminal and must not depend on a graphical user interface (GUI).

## 🚀 How to Submit

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new folder in the `submissions` directory with your project name
3. Add your project files and a README.md explaining your project
4. Submit a pull request

Your submission should include:
- Source code
- Pre-built Linux binaries
- A README.md explaining:
  - What your program does
  - How to run it
  - Any dependencies or requirements
  - Why you created it

## 🎁 The Reward

If your submission is approved, you'll receive a Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB) to continue your programming journey!

## 💡 Project Ideas

Here are some unique ideas to get you started:
- A terminal-based procedural dungeon generator with interactive exploration
- A text-based particle system simulator with physics
- A command-line tool that visualizes sorting algorithms with ASCII art
- A terminal-based music synthesizer that creates sounds using mathematical functions
- A text-based roguelike game with unique mechanics

Remember: The more original and creative your project is, the better! These are just starting points - feel free to come up with your own unique ideas!
