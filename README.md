# TerminalCraft Project Submission

## Project Details

1. **What is the name of your project?**
   - **cpp-snake**

2. **How many hours did you spend developing this?**
   - **I worked on it at school with a friend, for about 10-15 whole lessons or so**

3. **Briefly describe what your project is. What makes it unique?**
   It is a simple traditional snake game, written in c++ in the c++11 standard, using my very own, build-from-scratch TUI lib, 'cpptui'.
   It is really light weight, runs on really basic hardware, and performs quite well.

   It was a really good way to practice library development (cpptui), and game development, all connected by the beauty of tui apps.

6. **Does your project include a Readme file with instructions on how to use it?**
   - **Yes**
