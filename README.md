# Space Trader

A command-line interface (CLI) space trading simulation game built in Python.

## Description

Space Trader puts you in the role of an interstellar merchant navigating a universe of 10 unique planets. Your goal is to build your fortune through strategic trading, resource management, and completing special missions within a 100-day time limit.

Starting with a modest ship and limited credits, you'll make your way through a universe where prices fluctuate, pirates lurk in the darkness of space, and economic conditions change without warning.

## Features

- **Dynamic Trading System**: Buy and sell 6 different commodities across planets with specialized economies
- **Ship Management**: Balance cargo capacity and fuel consumption
- **Economic Challenges**: Take loans, manage debt, and build your net worth
- **Random Events**: Navigate trade embargoes, pirate attacks, economic booms, and more
- **Special Missions**: Complete delivery contracts for additional income
- **Save/Load System**: Continue your journey across multiple play sessions

## Requirements

## Gameplay Tips

- Start with short, profitable trade routes between neighboring planets

## Final Score

After 100 days (or when you choose to quit), your performance will be evaluated based on:

You'll receive a final rank ranging from "Galactic Trade Magnate" (the best) to "Indebted Space Vagrant" (the worst).
