How would it be if chess engines were played in the terminal?

WELL YOU GOT THIS!
## Usage
Download the release for your specific Operating System.
Execute it with shell or bash or whatever you use.

You can also build it yourself but remember I used deno and not node/npm, so clone the repo initialize with deno install the required packages and run it (the main.js) file.

Choose your favorite engine!
We support a random player engine (easy), SamannoyB Engine (intermediate), Stockfish (Hard)

Please try to make moves using standard Algebraic Notation (e4, Nf3, Bc6, Qd2, Ke4, etc.)

## Technologies Used:
Deno, chess.js, JavaScript, Arch Linux (I use arch btw)

### Thanks for Watching! Please approve my request! :) I tried my best in the midst of boards exams :D
