## Project Details

   It is a simple traditional snake game, written in c++ in the c++11 standard, using my very own, build-from-scratch TUI lib, 'cpptui'.
   It is really light weight, runs on really basic hardware, and performs quite well.

   It was a really good way to practice library development (cpptui), and game development, all connected by the beauty of tui apps.
