Essay Assisstant in Terminal

Functionality:
This program helps you organize essays for college/camp applications. Google Docs kinda works, but this is much more streamlined and its all stored locally
If you're a new user, add at least 3 (preferably 5+) before you use the AI 

This program helps you do the following all in your terminal:
1. Store, view, remove, and find essays you've written 
2. Compare prompts to previous ones you've written to help save time
3. Streamline writing w/ AI as a starting point

Please note: This program is powered by HackClub's DeepSeek API, so don't abuse the AI features. If you find yourself using the AI excessively, just use DeepSeek normally
