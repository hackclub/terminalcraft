Clippy is a terminal based devloper suite I originally made it for powershell but I have now added the linux binaries and modified the powershell-only tools to work on any platform.
The app installation proccess is in my original respitory. This project took me about 15 hours to complete I did use AI for help when I received a problem with my code that I could not resolve but everything else as done by me.
