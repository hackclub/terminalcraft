→ This project was made for terminal craft
→ It is very simple to use
→ You can copy and paste the code directly o a C++ IDE (Code:Blocks, Dev C++)or if you don't have one you can paste the code on this link and run it: https://www.onlinegdb.com/ My project is a simple task manager.

I created it for my small business as I have no previous experience in Excel and I find it hard to keep track of everything in it. So I made my own! 

The program has a few features, like:
-Calculator
-To-Do list
-Inventory manager

When you run the program 4 options will pop up. By entering a number you chose the task that you want the program to run.

Also program saves all data that you entered in it. 

Example:
if you inputted a few To-Do tasks like:
-order cheeseburgers
-drink water
the program will automatically save them.
Also, if you delete the tasks they will stay deleted when you re-run the program.

Additionally, you can keep track of your inventory.
You can add an item name, amout of items that you have and a description of the item.

NEW FEATURE: Multiple business managing. 
Now when you run the program the first thing you have to do is to create a business.
You can open as many businesses as you want and keep track of everything separately.

Example: 1.
Candle business 
Tasks:
buy wax
post about the brand new honey scent

Printing business
Inventory: 20L Magenta 20L of magenta

Other changes:
Optimization for faster program compiling and running.

Happy compiling!
