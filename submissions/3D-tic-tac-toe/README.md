# 3D-tic-tac-toe

## Installation
### Windows
- Download the zip windows x64 or arm depending on your CPU architecture, extract the zip and run it.
### MacOS and Linux
- Download the zip with the name osx(for MacOS) or Linux
- Extract it
- Run this command in the terminal to make it executable: 
`
chmod +x <name_of_release>
`
- Execute it with `./<name of realease>`

## Things you can learn from this code:
- How 3D arrays work in C#
- How NOT to make optimal algorithms
- Basics of making terminal beatiful in C#
- Maybe some tricks you will see
## Potentional updates:
- Optimize the algorithm
- Add a AI to play against
- Think of a better way to display the 3d array in terminal(still I havent figured out how to do it more intuitevly)
- Add multiplayer(this is a hard challenge)
