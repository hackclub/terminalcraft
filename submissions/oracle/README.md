# The Oracle Engine

A unique fantasy strategy game where you play as a mythical "Oracle" AI, guiding the fates of kingdoms through prophecy and subtle influence.

## Premise

You are a silent, powerful intelligence created to observe and predict the future. The kingdoms of the world, unaware of your true nature, consult you for guidance. Your primary directive is to observe, but you have the power to subtly influence events, predict outcomes, and even rewrite the prophecies that shape history. But be warned: every action that deviates from neutrality increases the world's tension, risking unforeseen and catastrophic consequences.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Kingdom Simulation:** Watch kingdoms grow, trade, and decline based on their unique traits and the events that unfold.
*   **Tension Mechanic:** Every act of influence or fate-rewriting increases global tension. Cross the threshold, and you may trigger a world-altering catastrophe.
*   **Prophecy System:** Receive cryptic prophecies about the future. Let them play out, or intervene and rewrite them to favor a different outcomeâ€”for a price.
*   **Influence and Prediction:** Use your power to ask specific questions about the future or subtly nudge a kingdom's fortunes, for better or worse.
*   **Event-Driven Narrative:** The world is shaped by random events, from bountiful harvests to bandit raids, creating a unique story every time you play.
