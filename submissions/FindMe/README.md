## Hallo and Welcome to FindMe tool.
### Descrption: FindMe tool is a simple TUI for the Find commands. It is easy to use to find any files on the hard drive. It is making finding files easier and faster.
## How to install
### Linux:
Simply you need to download the FindMe.sh file and execute it with this command ```./FindMe.sh```.

The same way but you need to have homebrew installed to make the tool install the required commands.
