# 2048-Shell
A 2048 game with a twist, playable directly in your terminal using a Bash shell script.

## Features
- Play 2048 in your terminal with simple keyboard commands.
- No dependencies-just Bash!
- Keeps track of your score.
- New [multiplier](#multipliers) feature.
- 3 Difficulty levels:
  - Easy: 6x6 grid, classic normal game.
  - Hard: 4x4 grid, 20% chance each for a "x2" or "/2".
  - Expert: 4x4 grid, 60% chance for "/2", 20% chance for "x2".
- This version adds the forbidden 1 (you get it by passing 2 through a "/2" multiplier).
- Easy to use and lightweight (literally no dependencies).

## Multipliers
This is a new feature that adds a twist to the classic game. In addition to the standard 2s and 4s, you can now encounter:
- `x2` - Doubles the value of the tile.
- '/2' - Halves the value of the tile.

These multipliers can appear randomly on the board anytime.

- **Hard Difficulty**: Only 1 multiplier per at a time, and it goes away after the current turn.
- **Expert Difficulty**: More than 1 multipliers can be on the board at the same time, and they stay until they are used.

Note: Multipliers don't change their position on the board, they just modify the tile going through them.
