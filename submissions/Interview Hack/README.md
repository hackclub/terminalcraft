**Interview Simulator** is a terminal-based Python application that simulates a technical interview using multiple-choice questions (similar to ICFES/ICETEX/entry-level tech tests). It’s designed for practicing under pressure with a timer, increasing difficulty levels, score tracking, and motivational feedback.
