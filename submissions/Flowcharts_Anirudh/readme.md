# ASCII Flowchart Maker

## What is this?

Hi! This is a command line tool that helps you **draw flowcharts in your terminal** using only text
You know those boxes and arrows that show what happens next? Yeah this makes those!

It's like drawing a map of your ideas 

And then connect them with arrows to show what happens first, next, last
