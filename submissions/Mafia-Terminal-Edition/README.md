# 🎭 Mafia: Terminal Edition

**Mafia: Terminal Edition** is a console-based story-mode game inspired by the classic social deduction game *Mafia*. In this version, players immerse themselves in a suspenseful narrative by selecting one of three roles — each shaping a unique path through the story. The game is designed for fun, strategy, and entertainment.

## 🧩 About the Game

This is not just a simple Mafia simulation — it’s a narrative-driven experience that requires the player to understand the identity and nature of each role. Originally a real-life social experiment, *Mafia* has been transformed here into a fully playable terminal-based game where storytelling, role decisions, and social logic come together.
