# Time Drift

A CLI-based sci-fi temporal puzzle adventure where you play as a chrono-drifter stuck in a time loop. Explore a research station, interact with characters, solve puzzles, and manipulate time to escape the loop.

## Unique Features

- **Temporal Memory**: Your knowledge persists across time loops, allowing you to learn and adapt.
- **Object Permanence**: Some objects can be made to persist between loops.
- **Causality Web**: Your actions create ripples in the timeline that may have consequences.
- **Timeline Branching**: Create alternate timelines through significant choices.
- **Temporal Anomalies**: Encounter and resolve glitches in the fabric of time.
- **Time Fragment Abilities**: Collect time fragments to power special temporal abilities.
- **ASCII Timeline Visualization**: View your progress and changes to the timeline.
- **Temporal Echoes**: Discover and interact with echoes from past or future timelines.
- **Paradox Points**: Earn points by resolving anomalies and discovering echoes.
- **Temporal Skills**: Unlock special abilities using paradox points.
- **Time Rifts**: Create portals between locations for instant travel.
- **Quantum States**: Manipulate the quantum state of objects to solve puzzles.
- **Parallel Selves**: Create alternate versions of yourself with unique abilities.

## How to Play

1. Run the game with `python time_drift.py`
2. Navigate the research station using movement commands
3. Interact with characters and objects to gather information
4. Make choices that affect the timeline
5. Use your knowledge from previous loops to solve puzzles
6. Collect time fragments to use special abilities
7. Discover temporal echoes to earn paradox points
8. Unlock and use temporal skills to manipulate reality
9. Create time rifts for instant travel between locations
10. Try to break the time loop and escape

## Game Objective

You're trapped in a 7-day time loop at a temporal research facility. Your goal is to understand what caused the loop and find a way to break it without destabilizing the timeline. Each loop gives you more knowledge and opportunities to change the outcome.

## Commands

### Basic Commands
- `go/move/travel <location>` - Move to a connected location
- `wait/advance/time` - Advance time to the next period
- `inventory/items/i` - Check your inventory
- `knowledge/know/k` - Review what you've learned
- `examine/look/x [object]` - Examine your surroundings or a specific object
- `talk/speak/ask <character>` - Speak with a character
- `interact/event/e [number]` - Interact with available events
- `choose/select/c <number>` - Make a choice during an event
- `timeline/tl` - Visualize the current timeline
- `causality/web/cw` - View the causality web of your actions
- `memories/loops/mem` - Review memories from previous loops
- `save` - Save your game
- `load` - Load your game
- `help/?` - Show help text
- `quit/exit` - Quit the game

### Temporal Abilities
- `rewind` - Spend 3 time fragments to rewind time (go back one time period)
- `glimpse` - Spend 2 time fragments to glimpse possible futures

### Advanced Temporal Commands
- `echoes/echo [number]` - View and interact with temporal echoes in your location
- `paradox/points/pp [unlock <skill>]` - View and spend paradox points to unlock skills
- `rift/rifts [create/use <target>]` - Create and use time rifts between locations
- `quantum/q [object] [state]` - Manipulate the quantum state of objects
- `parallel/self/clone [create/use]` - Create and utilize parallel versions of yourself

## Tips

- Your knowledge persists across time loops
- Some objects can be made to persist across loops
- Your actions create ripples in the timeline that may have consequences
- Pay attention to character schedules and patterns
- Collect time fragments by resolving temporal anomalies
- Look for temporal echoes in each location to earn paradox points
- Unlock temporal skills to gain powerful new abilities
- Create time rifts to quickly travel between locations
- Use quantum states to solve puzzles and unlock new paths
- Create parallel selves with complementary abilities to overcome challenges
- Be careful with timeline manipulation - too many changes can destabilize reality
