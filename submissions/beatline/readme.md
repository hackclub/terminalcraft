# Beatline üé∂

Beatline is a terminal-based real-time music visualizer. It captures audio (via microphone or file) and renders various visualizations like waveform, spectrum bars, pulse matrix, radial rings, and frequency zones right inside your terminal.

## üîß Features
- **Waveform**: See the audio waveform in real time.
- **Spectrum**: Bar graph showing frequency distribution.
- **Pulse**: Radial pulses synced to audio volume.
- **CircleBands**: Circular visual representation of energy bands.
- **Zones**: Frequency-labeled horizontal bands (SUB, BASS, MIDS, TREBLE).
- **Squares**: Intensity-based glowing quadrants.

üí° Why I Created It

I wanted a fun, fast, hackable music visualizer that could run directly in a terminal, without GUI frameworks or external displays. This was also a great way to explore audio processing and terminal graphics together.
