# -------------------------💻🎙️ TerminalTalks 🎙️💻 --------------------------

TerminalTalks is an **offline, voice-powered command suggestion tool** for Linux. Speak natural phrases like _"list files"_ or _"check IP,"_ and it will suggest the appropriate terminal command like `ls` or `ip a`. Perfect for when you forget commands or want hands-free Linux exploration!

## ✨ Features  
- 🛜 **Works completely offline** (no internet required after setup)  
- 🇮🇳 Supports **Indian English accent** using Vosk STT model  
- 📋 Maps speech to **150+ common Linux commands**  
- ⚡ **Simple one-command install** script  
- 🔧 Easy to modify and expand command set  
- 🐧 Beginner-friendly, works on most Linux systems  

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. Run `terminal-talks` from any terminal  
2. It starts listening to your voice 🎤  
3. Speech is transcribed locally using Vosk  
4. Searches for matching command in its dictionary  
5. Shows the best Linux command match  
6. Copy and run it manually  

**Example:**  
🎤 You say: _"list all files"_  
💻 It shows: `Suggested command: ls -a`
