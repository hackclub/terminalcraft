ðŸš€ TraceShell v2.0 â€“ Advanced Activity Tracking & Productivity Analytics

TraceShell is a powerful, privacy-focused activity tracker that monitors your computer usage and gives smart insights to help you work better. It tracks apps, windows, URLs, and gives optional AI tips.

âœ¨ Features: Application Monitoring â€“ Track time spent in each app. Window Title Capture â€“ See what files or tabs you used. URL Tracking â€“ Automatically logs visited sites. Cross-Platform â€“ Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Detailed Analytics: Daily and weekly time reports. Breakdown of app usage. Find your most productive hours. Full session logs with time.

AI-Powered Insights (Optional): Get AI tips to improve your focus. Understand patterns in your habits. Receive smart productivity scores.

Privacy First: Everything is stored locally on your computer. No cloud or online sync. You decide how long to keep data. You can choose what it tracks and what it ignores.

Quick Start: Install dependencies with "pip install requests psutil". On Linux/macOS, make it executable with "chmod +x traceshell.py".

To start tracking: python traceshell.py start
To see activity: python traceshell.py show
To check status: python traceshell.py status
To stop tracking: python traceshell.py stop

Core Commands: start â€“ begin tracking, stop â€“ stop it, status â€“ show if it's running, show â€“ see your activity, cleanup â€“ delete old data.

Time Options: show (today), show --period yesterday, show --period week, show --date YYYY-MM-DD (example: 2024-12-25).

Detailed Analysis: --detail "Google Chrome" shows browser time, --detail "VS Code" --period week shows weekly coding time, --detail "Microsoft Word" --date 2024-12-20 shows Word usage that day.

AI Insights: Set your OpenAI key with export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here". Then use --ai flag like this: show --ai or show --period week --ai.

Filter Results: show --type app, show --type file, show --type url. You can also limit with --limit 20.
