Welcome to ByteQuest: Terminal Edition, a classic rogue-like adventure that runs directly in your terminal. Navigate a dangerous dungeon, outsmart intelligent enemies, avoid traps, and find the key to escape. Built with pure Python, this game is a lightweight and fun demonstration of object-oriented programming and dynamic level generation.

# Features
Classic Rogue-like Gameplay: A simple yet challenging dungeon-crawl experience focused on survival and exploration.

Selectable Difficulty Levels: Choose from three distinct challenges:

* Easy: More health and fewer threats for a casual playthrough.

* Hard: The standard, balanced experience.

* Impossible: A true test of skill with low health and numerous dangers.

Dynamic Level Generation: The positions of the key, traps, and enemies are randomized for each playthrough, guaranteeing a unique experience and preventing items from overlapping.

Smart Enemy: Enemies don't just mindlessly chase you. They use a line-of-sight algorithm and a probabilistic chase mechanic, making their behavior less predictable and more strategic. You can use walls and corners to your advantage to break pursuit.

Tactical Knockback Mechanic: Colliding with an enemy knocks them back, giving you a crucial moment of breathing room and adding a layer of tactical depth to combat.

Colorful Terminal Graphics: The game uses ANSI escape codes to create a vibrant and clear visual experience, right in your command line.
