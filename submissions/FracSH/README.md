# FracSH - Terminal Fractal Explorer and Renderer

FracSH is a fast, rabbit hole of a fractal explorer. 
It has built in Mandelbrot, Julia, Multibrot, Burning Ship, custom formulas, colored ASCII (or unicode.), BMP export (implemented by me!), and more‚Äîall in Python!

## Features

- Real-time terminal fractal rendering (Mandelbrot, Julia, Multibrot, Burning Ship, ...)
- Custom formula support (enter your own mandelbrot formulas.)
- Colored ASCII mode (for nostalgia!)
- Julia mode for any formula (experimental, 50/50 chance of working.)
- Multithreaded rendering for fast previews and BMP export (fully working, very fast for python standards.)
- Progress bars for both preview and BMP rendering (mandelbrot-8 so slow, the preview has a progress bar ü•Ä)
- Parameter import/export (go back to your fav location)
- Resolution prompt for BMP export (customized resolutions such as user defined resolutions, common is 1024x600 for being fast to render and clarity.)
- Multiple color palettes and coloring modes (CGA Included!)
- Keyboard controls for zoom, pan, palette, fractal, and more (Down below!)

## Usage

1. **Run the program:**
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Controls:**
   - Arrows / WASD: Pan (You can even scroll with a mouse to go up and down instead of W and S)
   - + / -: Zoom in/out
   - P: Next palette
   - F: Next fractal
   - O: Next coloring mode
   - H: Home/reset view
   - B: Export BMP (with resolution prompt)
   - C: Enter custom formula
   - J: Toggle Julia mode
   - U: Toggle ASCII mode
   - Z: Export parameters
   - Y: Import parameters
   - Q: Quit (or CTRL-C :3)

3. **Custom formulas:**  (im not a mathematician so i don't know much about creating my own custom formulas, but there you go! works.)
   When prompted, enter two comma-separated expressions for the real and imaginary parts, for example an mandelbrot set looks like this:
   ```
   zx*zx-zy*zy+cx,2*zx*zy+cy
   ```

4. **BMP Export:**  
   Press B, enter your wanted resolution (e.g. 1920x1080, 512x512), and wait for the progress bar to finish. (actually works!)

## Requirements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT RUN IN A READ-ONLY ENVIRONMENT! FOR THE BMP SAVING FUNCTIONALITY TO WORK, THE SUBMISSION MUST BE LOCATED IN A READ-WRITE ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS THE USER FOLDER! ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Python 3.13.5 (only tested on latest version, older might work without issues.)
- [blessed](https://pypi.org/project/blessed/) (`pip install blessed`)
