"# tic-tac-toe-ysws"

This is a tic-tac-toe game made in C. The user can choose between O and X and play with the computer. They would have to choose the row number and row column for submitting their position. Once they put - for eg. row-1, column-1, their move would be stored and played. The computer would hence choose a random place to play!

Edit- I put in the multiplayer mode and some other additional features to make the game smooth and fun to play as well.
Beat the computer and win the game as much time as anyone wants to!
