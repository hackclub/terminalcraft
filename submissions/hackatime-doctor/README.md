2. Extract the zip file to your desired location
3. Open PowerShell in the extracted folder
4. Choco (Chocolatey) is required for the installation. If you don't have it installed, follow these steps:

   1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
   2. Run the following command to install Chocolatey:

      ```powershell
      iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

    2. Run the following command to install OpenSSL:

       ```powershell
       choco install openssl
       ```
6. Set console encoding to UTF-8 (recommended for proper output display in powershell):

   ```powershell
   # Temporary (for current session only):
   [Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8

   # Permanent (add to PowerShell profile):
   Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value "[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8"
   ```

6. Run the executable directly from the extracted folder, or for global access, copy hackatime-doctor.exe to a directory in your system PATH (like C:\Program Files\HackaTime Doctor)
