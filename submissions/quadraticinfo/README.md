# Quadratic Information Finder
This program allows the user to find useful information about a quadratic.

## How to use
Using one of the binaries, run it in the terminal. You will then be prompted for the equation, and afterwards will be given calculated information about the quadratic.

## Why create this
I did it to make solving quadratics faster, as it gives general information based on the input rather than how a calculator could solve for each aspect invidually.

## Dependencies
libm (Math library)
Headers: cmath, cstdio
