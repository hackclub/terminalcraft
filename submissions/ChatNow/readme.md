# Whats ChatNow?
### ChatNow is a CLI tool which, when a server (server.py) is running you can send messages to other clients on your network. The client has an easy to use UI which when ran in your CLI of your choice will take you through connecting to the server and therefore allowing you to send messages.

# Setup
### To setup ChatNow make sure the server (server.py) is running on your network. When running server.py ChatNow Server Setup will start. You will then be told the server IP and port to connect. You'll also be told some did you know facts.
